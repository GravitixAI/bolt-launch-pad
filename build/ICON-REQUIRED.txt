⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Add Application Icon ⚠️

Before packaging your application, you MUST add an icon file:

FILE NEEDED: icon.ico
LOCATION: This folder (build/icon.ico)
FORMAT: Windows Icon (.ico)
SIZE: 256x256 pixels (or larger)

QUICK SOLUTION:
1. Go to https://www.icoconverter.com/
2. Upload your logo/icon as PNG or JPG
3. Download the .ico file
4. Save it as: build/icon.ico

ALTERNATIVE:
Use the temp-icon.png in this folder as a starting point:
1. Upload temp-icon.png to https://convertio.co/png-ico/
2. Download the converted icon.ico
3. Place it in this folder

Without icon.ico, the app will use the default Electron icon!

For production apps, create a professional icon with your branding.
